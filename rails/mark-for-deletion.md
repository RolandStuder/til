# Mark for destruction

If you want to destroy some associated records, but wait until the parents saves, you can use mark for destruction

https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/AutosaveAssociation/mark_for_destruction

> Marks this record to be destroyed as part of the parentâ€™s save transaction. This does not actually destroy the record instantly, rather child record will be destroyed when parent.save is called.
>
> Only useful if the :autosave option on the parent is enabled for this associated model.
